# Simpson's Method
#### The purpose of the Simpson's Method is to estimate the integral of a function based on a select number of points in the form of an array. This algorithm combines the Simpson's 1/3 Rule, the Simpson's 3/8 Rule, and the Trapezoid Rule to form an estimate of an integral.

##### Inputs:
##### x-the x array including equally spaced x-values
##### y-the y array including the outputs values of the function

##### Outputs:
##### I-the integral estimation is one number that is the estimation over the range of x-values
