# LU Factorization
#### The LU Factorization Method algorithm determines the LU Factorization of an inputted matrix. This decomposition makes it easy do determine the unknown values of the matrix as well as perform multiple calculations using different output values within the matrix.This method uses pivoting to solve the LU Factorization.

##### Inputs:
##### A-The coefficient matrix

##### Outputs:
##### L-The lower triangular matrix
##### U-The upper triangular matrix
##### P-The pivoting matrix
