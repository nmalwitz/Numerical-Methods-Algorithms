# False Position Method
#### The purpose of the False Position Method is to estimate the roots of a function based on some initial guess seen in the inputs section.

##### Inputs:
##### func-the function being evaluated
##### xl-the lower guess
##### xu-the upper guess
##### es-the relative error which is 0.0001%
##### maxiter-the number of iterations desired

##### Outputs:
##### root-the zeros of the function
##### fx-the function evaluated for the root of the equation
##### ea-the approximate relative error
##### iter- the number of iterations performed
